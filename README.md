# ðŸ§  DCIC Smart Labeler (Colab Edition)

This repository presents a complete implementation of a **data-centric image classification labeler** submitted to the [DCIC Challenge 2025](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/17039). The objective is to intelligently label a large image dataset with minimal annotations using **CLIP**, **UMAP**, **Active Learning**, and **Label Propagation**, resulting in low KL divergence scores while staying under a fixed annotation budget.
